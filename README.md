# GUI Java Sorting – University Project (2nd Semester)

This is a simple swing Java program developed as part of the **Algorithms and Data Structures** course during the second semester of university.

The goal of the project was to understand and implement core sorting algorithms in Java, demonstrating how each works in practice.

## Features

- Bubble Sort  
- Selection Sort  
- Insertion Sort  
- Merge Sort  
- Quick Sort  
- Console-based input/output

## Purpose

This project helped reinforce sorting algorithm logic, memory management, and runtime behavior — all essential fundamentals for deeper algorithmic thinking and the difference of time complexity of them.
