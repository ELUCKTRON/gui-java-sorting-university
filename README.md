# 🧮 GUI Java Sorting – University Project (2nd Semester)

A simple but effective Java Swing application created for the **Algorithms and Data Structures** course during Semester 2 at university.

This application showcases benchmark results for various sorting algorithms using randomly generated arrays of different lengths.
While the GUI focuses on performance comparison, each sorting algorithm is also fully implemented in the source code — allowing a clear view of their internal logic and behavior.
